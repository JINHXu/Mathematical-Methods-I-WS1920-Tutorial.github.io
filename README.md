### Further tips on constructing natural deduction:

Start with premises or auxiliary assumptions plugged in here.<br/>
While auxiliary assumptions have to be discharged later at some point.<br/>
__How to decide what auxiliary assumptions to plug in?<br/>__
*Observe the premises and conclusions, see the relevance, and consider what to plug in to get to the conclusion with useing the premises and rules.<br/>*
Then at each step of derivation, aplly rules(elimination and/or introduction) toawrds the goal of getting to the conclusion.<br/>
__Which rules to use at each step?(Central issue)<br/>__
*Conisder how you can get from the current point to the conclusion while all the auxliary assumptions being discharged before finishing.<br/>*
Premises can come into play at any step when it is useful.

### Specific notes on Ex4:
  (1) refer to part of the example shown on board suring tutorial.<br/>
  (2) constructing an implication: refer to the implication construction in the example in tutorial.<br/>
  (3) No premises: come up with auxiliary assumptions and derive step by step towards the cinclusion. Construct the                 implication structureas what we did in the example.<br/>
  (4) Don't forget to do it both directions.<br/>
  (5) more than one premises here, plug in at the proper step of deduction when it serve the purpose of either discharging and auxiliary assumtion or drawing the conclusion.<br/>

### Sum

Refer closely to the example shown in the tutorial:

* Follow the writing style.
* Get inspiration on how to form an implication(implication construction, where in the example was formed from the very first step/aux assump./ up to the conclusion) when there is implication in the conclusion.
* Get inspiration on what auxiliary assumption to plug in by observing the premises and conclusion(We plugged in the very aux assump. in the example because we saw that relevance between premise and conclusion).

### Page 4 of Example sheet

*As we did not have time to cover the one last page of the example sheet which contains the thinking. You can read it by yourselve if this interests or confuses you. We may discuss this week if we have time.*

## Week 05
* [Example Sheet 05](https://github.com/JINHXu/Mathematical-Methods-I-WS1920-Tutorial.github.io/raw/master/example%20sheet%2005.pdf)

_More examples of natural deduction could be found in the literature_ **Partee, B. H.., A. ter Meulen & R. E. Wall, Mathematical Methods in Linguistics, Kluwer, Dordrecht 1990(chapter 6)**_(examples in Fitch style)._

## Week 06

* [Example Sheet 06](https://github.com/JINHXu/Mathematical-Methods-I-WS1920-Tutorial.github.io/raw/master/EX06.pdf)

A fact:<br/>
Unlike the tradition we follow here in this course, when declaring a set in Python, duplicate elements will be automatically deleted.
```
>>> myset = {1,1,1,2}
>>> myset
{1, 2}
>>> 
```
But notice, as being mentioned in the slides, we do allow duplicate elements in a set: <br/>
_"it is also inessential how often an object is named in list notation"_
