### Further tips on constructing natural deduction:

Start with premises or auxiliary assumotions plugged in here.<br/>
While auxiliary assumptions have to be discharged later at some point.<br/>
_How to decide what auxiliary assumptions to plug in?<br/>_
Observe the premises and conclusions, see the relevance, and consider what to plug in to get to the conclusion with useing the premises and rules.<br/>
Then at each step of derivation, aplly rules(elimination and/or introduction) toawrds the goal of getting to the conclusion.<br/>
_Which rules to use at each step?(Central issue)<br/>_
Conisder how you can get from the current point to the conclusion while all the auxliary assumptions being discharged before finishing.<br/>
Premises can come into play at any step when it is useful.

### Specific notes on Ex4:
* (1) refer to part of the example shown on board suring tutorial.
* (2) constructing an implication: refer to the implication construction in the example in tutorial.
* (3) No premises: come up with auxiliary assumptions and derive step by step towards the cinclusion. Construct the implication structureas what we did in the example.
* (4) Don't forget to do it both directions.
* (5) more than one premises here, plug in at the proper step of deduction when it serve the purpose of either discharging and auxiliary assumtion or drawing the conclusion.
